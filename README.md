## ðŸŒŸ Executive Summary

This project establishes a data-driven solution to a multi-billion dollar problem: predicting driver pay in the New York City for-hire vehicle market. By leveraging a massive dataset of over **10 million trips**, we developed a predictive model that significantly improves upon traditional methods. Our final model, built using **LightGBM**, achieved an impressive performance, reducing the average prediction error by **more than 40%** compared to a standard linear model. This predictive capability can serve as a core component of a platform to optimize driver earnings, improve operational efficiency, and create a multi-million dollar valuation for a data-driven service in the gig economy.

## ðŸš€ Workflow

1.  **EDA & Feature Engineering**
    * Explored a dataset of **10.6 million records** and **81 features** to understand key patterns in driver earnings.
    * Engineered high-impact features such as `time_of_day` and `is_weekend` to capture temporal demand and cost drivers.

2.  **Model Training & Evaluation**
    * Developed and benchmarked a simple **Linear Regression** model against a more advanced **LightGBM** model.
    * Evaluated models using key metrics like **R-squared (RÂ²)**, **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**, and **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**.

3.  **Predictions on New Data**
    * Applied the trained LightGBM model to unseen data to demonstrate its ability to provide accurate and reliable predictions for new trips.
