# 🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

🔎 **Key Insights from NYC Taxi Data:**

| Feature         | Insight                     | Business Relevance          |
| --------------- | --------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| Pickup Hour     | Peaks 8–10 AM, 5–7 PM       | Align fleet with rush hours |
| Day of Week     | Fridays & Saturdays highest | Weekend surge pricing       |
| Pickup Zones    | Manhattan dominates demand  | Driver routing optimization |
| Trip Distance   | Long-tail distribution      | Outlier removal essential   |
| Passenger Count | Weak predictor              | Dropped as feature          |

# 🛠️ Feature Engineering

* Cyclical encoding of **time features** (hour, day of week).
* **Log transformation** of trip distance (reduce skew).
* **Categorical encoding** of Vendor IDs & zones.
* **Outlier filtering**: trips > 50 miles or > 2 hours removed.

✨ *Cleaner, business-aligned features powering better predictions.*
